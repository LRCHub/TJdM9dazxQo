People, what's goin' on
Right is right and wrong is wrong
Can you imagine, yeah, life without love
Just pushin' and fightin'
And nothing from above
Come on, people
Turn yourself around
Wipe away that frown, come on
And let your love come down
Brighten up this town
With a joyful sound, yeah, yeah
And let your love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa, mmm, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa, mmm, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
I remember when I was a boy
Life was very simple like a big toy
Now I'm older, life is more complex
And I'm surrounded by people
Trapped in a negative vex
Come on, people
Turn yourself around
Wipe away that frown, come on
And let your love come down
Brighten up this town
With a joyful sound, yeah, yeah
And let your love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Let your love come down, all over this town

Go on and bless the children with a joyful sound
A song that gives more than it takes
By true artists, not artistic fakes
Love is of Heaven and before it will show
It takes a lot of time and then to let it grow
Because in life, you reap just what you sow
So now you know
Come on, people
Turn yourself around
Wipe away that frown, come on
And let your love come down
Brighten up this town
With a joyful sound, yeah, yeah
And let your love come down, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
(Oh-whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh...
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Come on
If you want to show the world
Exactly how you feel
Open up your heart
And you must always be real
If you want to show someone
Exactly who you are
Let your love come down
And you will always shine like a star
Yeah, yeah...
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Love come down
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Oh-whoa-whoa
(Let your love come, let your love come down)
Love come down...
