O sleep last night, I been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
I just can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Deep in the night you took my heart
Now danger's in sight
I just can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Girl you make my love come down
Girl you make my love come on down
All the way down
Girl you make my love come on down
Can't do without your tender love
There's no way out
And I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Girl you make my love come down
Girl you make my love come on down
All the way down
Girl you make my love come down
All the way down
Girl you make my love come on down
You make my love come down
Girl you make my love come on down
You make my love come down
Girl you make my love come down
All the way down
Girl you make my love come on down
