Baby please stay tonight
I don't want to be alone
Your love is all I'm livin' for
Ooo ooo, yeah

Oh love come down

Hey baby let me tell you what's on my mind
I can't sleep at night thinkin' of you all the time
I've been keepin' your picture up on my shelf
Your lovin' is so good I don't want nobody else

Nobody else
I don't want nobody
Nobody else
Don't you know that

You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down

Hey love come down
Hey love come down
Oh love come down

When you kiss me, it makes me weak
When I hold you it feels all so sweet
My body feels a certain emotion
It makes me want to break
It makes me want to go crazy

You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down

Holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, hey holdin' on
Holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, hey

Your love is like no other love
That I ever had before

You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
