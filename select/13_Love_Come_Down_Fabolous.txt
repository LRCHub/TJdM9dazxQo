Love Come Down

[Chorus]
All the way down (Down)
I can make your love come down (Come Down)
All the way down (Down)
I can make your love
Come down (Come Down)

[Verse 1]
Ha hah
Come on down
Bob barker bars
Back up in the spot
Like when you park a car
I heard she good
I like chocolate bars
I climb on walls like Peter Parker ma
I'm in the spider
Yeah the Peter Parker car
Gray with the black top
Like sharpie markers are
Hatin on a brother
Go ahead Obama me
(Go Ahead)
Cuz my bitch is badder than the economy (Wooh)
Shit
It just dawned on me
All of ya should honor me
They been offview
Ever since they caught on 2 me (Nice!)
Follow him on Twitter
I heard he's funny
Diddy tell em what it is

[Jay-Z Sample]
Show em how to move in a
Show em how to move in a
Show em how to move in a
Show em how to
Show em how to
Show em how to
Show em how to move in a room full of roaches

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ha hah
Fidda didda gang
We the team of choice
Welcome to the fraternity
Morgan Freeman voice
You get it how you live
You automatically in
Bitch if money talks
Let the chatter begin
They know me for nice cars
That I'll be in
Bringing bad girls to the club
No Natalie chin
This is family
No outside interference
I'm a son of a gun
Who wanna meet the parents? (Huh?)
I bring my loved ones round
Shorty give it up
Till the love come down
Drop 2 her knees
Love comes down
Can't blame me if I fall in love somehow (Nice!)

[Jay-Z Sample]

[Chorus]
