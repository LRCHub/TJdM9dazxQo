Love come down
All the way down
No sleep last night
Been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
Cause I can't help the way
that I feel
I just can't help the way
that I feel
Deep in the night
You took my heart
Now danger's in sight
Cause I can't help the way
that I feel
I just can't help the way
that I feel
Do, do, dit, dit, dit, dit,
dit, dit, do, do, do
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
Oh you make my love come down
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Can't do without
your tender love
There's no way out
And I can't help the way
that I feel
I just can't help the way
that I feel
Your love has a force
Got me under your spell
So take me on yours
And I can't help the way
that I feel
I just can't help the way
that I feel
Shoo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, oh
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
You make my love come down
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
(Baby, you make)
(Baby, you make my)
(Baby, you make)
(Baby, you make my)
(All the way down)
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
You make my love come down
Inside out when you're around
you make my love come down
(Baby, you make)
(Baby, you make my)
Love come down
you make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
You make my love come down
Inside out when you're around
you make my love come down
(Baby, you make)
(Love come down)
I can't help the way
that I feel without you, baby
I can't help the way I feel
(All the way down)
You make my,
you make my love come down
(You're around)
When you're around, baby, yeah
(Baby, you make, baby,
you make my love come down)
come down
Make it come all the way down
you make my love come down,
(You're around)
When you're around
(Baby, you make, baby,
you make my love come down)
